An advanced Git commit message generation utility designed to automatically craft high-quality commit messages with precision and sophistication.

Static site: https://git-intelligence-message.pages.dev/ 

This tool is still in its early stages. I am working on adding more features and fixing bugs. I am also working on adding more tests to ensure that the tool is reliable.

If you find any issues, please report them to me. I will do my best to fix them as soon as possible.

I look forward to hearing your feedback. Feel free to fire feature request or bug issue if you want and necessary: [Issues](https://github.com/davelet/git-intelligence-message/issues/new).

## Platform Support

This project now officially supports multiple platforms:
- Windows (7 and later)
- macOS (10.12 and later)
- Linux (most distributions)

The application has been tested on these platforms and should work without issues. If you encounter any platform-specific problems, please [report them](https://github.com/davelet/git-intelligence-message/issues/new).

Thank you for your interest in this project.
